mlkit-learn is a lightweight machine learning library designed to be **interactive**, **easy-to-understand**, and **educational**. It implements all of the classic machine learning algorithms from regression to gradient boosting trees. **With only two lines of code, users can witness popular Kaggle datasets being preprocessed and predicted in action**.

The reason why I created this project is that there isn't a place right now where people can just look at simple, yet well structured code and get some ideas about what is behind these powerful algorithms. All of the information is scattered across the internet like infinity stones and it seems like only grad students have access to the real thing. And source code of machine learning libraries like sklearn are too intimidating to read. These are the obstacles I faced when I got into machine learning. I put these ideas in mind and work really hard to make the code as simple as possible but powerful at the same time. There are demoes for you to try the algorithms with classic datasets, and you will get an accuracy score similar to those powerful libraries. [@journey.ai](https://www.instagram.com/journey.ai/) will be the place for you to get help if you are stuck somewhere reading the source code. It will be kept as simple as this repo.
